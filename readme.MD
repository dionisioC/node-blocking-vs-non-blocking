This is the code for:

https://dionisiocortes.es/nodejs/jsnsd/jsnad/2020/07/08/node.js-intro.html

This repo contains two folders that are code examples of blocking and non-blocking. The examples are similar to the ones in the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/blocking-vs-non-blocking/).

There are two folders:

[blocking](./blocking) with the blocking code

and

[non-blocking](./non-blocking) with the non-blocking code
